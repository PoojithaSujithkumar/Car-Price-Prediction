# 🚗 Car Price Prediction – Machine Learning Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is part of my **Data Science Internship at Oasis Infobyte**, where I developed a machine learning model to estimate **car prices** based on features like **brand, mileage, fuel type, and year**. Using **Linear Regression**, I built and evaluated the model to ensure accurate price predictions.  

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset includes:  
- **Car features:** Brand, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, etc.  
- **Target variable:** Car price  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  

## 🔍 Workflow  
✅ **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned missing values and handled categorical data.  
✅ **Feature Engineering:** Encoded categorical variables and standardized numerical features.  
✅ **Model Training:** Implemented **Linear Regression** for price prediction.  
✅ **Evaluation:** Used **MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² score** to measure model performance.  
✅ **Prediction:** Tested the model on new car listings to validate accuracy.  

## 📈 Results  
- Successfully developed a model that predicts **car prices based on key features**.  
- Gained insights into **feature impact on pricing** through correlation analysis.  

## 🚀 Key Learnings  
- Strengthened skills in **feature engineering, regression modeling, and data visualization**.  
- Learned how **market factors influence car valuation**.
