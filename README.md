# Car-Price-Prediction
I developed a machine learning model to predict car prices based on features like brand, mileage, fuel type, and year. Using Linear Regression, I trained and tested the model to estimate prices accurately. This project helped strengthen my skills in feature engineering, regression modeling, and model evaluation.
